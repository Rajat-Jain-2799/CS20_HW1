    <p>I grew up in Mumbai, India</p>
    <p>It is best practice to create a subfolder for images, especially if the project has many images.
        You can set the height or width and the other dimension will automatically be calculated.

        <img src="Mumbai_image.jpeg" alt="Favorite Place" >
        This is Mumbai, where I currently live. I love the weather becuase it's warm all throught the year, there are nice people, there 
        is always something to do and lastly that where my family is.

	<p>Here is an image with text wrapping. Aligment can be done as an attribute or with CSS.  
       The image must come before the text whether the alignment is right or left.
       The attribute, clear='all', with the br tag stops all text wrapping.
       Adding margin or padding will leave some space between the image and the text- more on this when we cover CSS.</p>
